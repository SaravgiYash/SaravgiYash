### Hi, I’m Yash 👋  

I’m a **Software Engineer II at Zeta**, working on production-grade incident management and applied AI systems in fintech.

My work focuses on building and scaling **AI-driven Incident Commanders**, distributed systems, and developer tooling used in real production environments. I enjoy working end-to-end — from system design and backend APIs to frontend dashboards and reliability.

Previously, I worked as a **Software Engineer Intern at Internet Archive**, where I helped build the Open Library Progressive Web App with offline support and accessibility, which has **100K+ downloads on the Google Play Store**.

- 🎓 B.E. from **BITS Pilani**
