### Hi there, I'm Yash ðŸ‘‹
I am currently working as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) at Zeta, a unicorn fintech startup, where I previously spent 3 years as an SDE Intern.  
  
Before that, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Internet Archive, an open-source organization, where I developed a Progressive Web App (PWA) for Open Library, focusing on offline support and accessibility, which led to over 100K downloads on the Google Play Store.

- ðŸŽ“ I graduated from BITS Pilani with a Bachelor of Engineering.
- ðŸ¥… 2024 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects.
